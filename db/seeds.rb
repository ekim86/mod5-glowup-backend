    ‚ö°KEY INGREDIENTS: Contains 20.5% pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and 72% black chokeberry, a special ingredient that stabilizes the high concentration of vitamin C to make sure skin remains hydrated and smooth. 
    ‚ö°WHO IS IT FOR?
    ‚ö°IT'S SUPER SUPER SUPER FRESH. In order for a pure vitamin C serum to be effective, it must be fresh. That's why we're making all Triple C Lightning Liquids in small batches and air shipping them directly from Korea to ensure that the serums are fresh and high quality. To maximize the effectiveness of your serum, it's best to store it in the refrigerator or a cool, dark place. Keep the bottle air tight!

    Honey skin is essentially the next level glow after healthy skin. It‚Äôs a huge trend on social media, and is #goals as far as dewy and glowy complexions are concerned. Keep in mind that healthy, normal skin doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt see any pores and flawless. Healthy skin means balanced skin, and that can be hard to recognize since every person‚Äôs skin is a bit different.

    'detail': "This box contains two different types of high-end cotton pads that are the perfect fit when used with the Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner to give you greater use out of your toner.
    Compressed Cotton Pad: Created through a water jet method to compress 100% pure cotton a total of five times, this cotton pad has been designed specifically to help tone the face. Because it helps following products absorb into the skin better by cleansing the face of any remaining dirt, oil and dead skin cells after cleansing, it is recommended that this step be taken before applying other skin care products.
    Sponge Cotton Pad: This cotton pad has been created similar to a sponge, so it collects the toner and returns the product back to the face, as compared to the conventional cotton pad that simply absorbs most of the product. Rather than using wiping motions to cleanse the face, this sponge is created to be more fit to hydrate the face through dabbing the sponge on the face and letting the skin naturally absorb the toner.Includes 60 Compressed Cotton Pads and 60 Sponge Cotton Pads (120 total). Compressed Cotton Pad: 100% cotton. Sponge Cotton Pad: Pulp + rayon blend",

    'detail': "Your favorite classic oil cleanser just got upgraded -- on the outside and inside!
    This cult favorite still goes on as a soft balm and melts off stubborn makeup seamlessly without stripping your skin of its natural oils. Perfect for oily skin, this formula includes resveratrol, which is a natural antioxidant that helps fight free radical damage.
    So what‚Äôs changed in the formula? Mineral oil has been replaced with natural ester oil, butylated hydroxytoluene is gone and skin-friendly vitamin E acetate is in it's place (allowing this cleanser to be used on all skin types, even kids!), and butyl parahydroxybenzoate has been replaced with phenoxyethanol, an ingredient naturally derived from green tea to provide a fresh, rose scent. Even more, the texture of the cleanser has been improved to be even smoother and softer with a higher melting point, meaning no more summer meltdowns! 
    The new packaging is perfect for your shelfie and the formula is better for your skin!
